# Power-BI
This project presents an interactive Credit Card Data Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI.
The dashboard provides insights into:

Customer demographics and spending behavior

Revenue distribution by card type, transaction category, and region

Monthly trends in usage and payments

Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total transactions, revenue, and active customers

The goal of this dashboard is to help stakeholders understand customer behavior, identify high-value segments, and support data-driven decision-making for credit card services.
